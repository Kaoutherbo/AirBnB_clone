Welcome to the AirBnB Clone project! This project is the first step towards building a full web application that emulates the functionality of Airbnb. In this project, we are going to create a command-line interface (CLI) known as "The Console," which allows us to manage AirBnB objects using various commands.

# Background Context
This project is designed to teach us various fundamental concepts in Python, including:

- Python packages and modules
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Creating a command-line interface (CLI)
- Serialization and deserialization of objects
- Unit testing using the unittest framework
The project aims to mimic the basic functionalities of Airbnb, focusing on creating classes to represent different elements of the application, managing object serialization and deserialization, and providing a command-line interface for interacting with the objects.

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```
https://github.com/ikramikram2020/AirBnB_clone
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd AirBnB_clone
```

Run the console:
```
./console.py
```
## Usage
Once the console is launched, you can start using various commands to manage your AirBnB objects. For a list of available commands, type help or help <command> to get more information about a specific command.

## Commands
The following commands are available in the console:

- create: Creates a new instance of a class and saves it to a JSON file.
- show: Displays the string representation of an instance.
- destroy: Deletes an instance based on the class name and ID.
- all: Displays all instances of a class or all instances in the storage.
- update: Updates the attributes of an instance.
- For a complete list of available commands, refer to the console's built-in help feature.

## File Structure
The project file structure is organized as follows:

- console.py: The main command-line interface (CLI) script.
- models/: Directory containing class definitions for different AirBnB objects.
- models/engine/: Directory containing the storage engine implementation.
- tests/: Directory containing unit tests for the project.
